[    0.00 -     3.20] People have asked me about this billion dollar use case that I dropped on
[    3.20 -     6.36] Claude Bot, probably one of the only things I see that's useful right now.
[    6.36 -    10.32] Anyways, it was inspired by a guy who ran up a net worth of $40 million.
[   10.32 -    11.68] And it's actually, I was actually wrong.
[   12.26 -    14.88] And his Twitter, it says 80 million now, regardless.
[   14.88 -    16.52] It's a lot from 20,000.
[   17.06 -    20.00] He essentially does a strategy called social arbitrage.
[   20.54 -    23.70] Long story short, you know that Wall Street is a bunch of, you know,
[   23.76 -    28.00] older, older gentlemen that are a little out of touch to what the kids are
[   28.00 -    28.96] doing. Okay.
[   29.00 -    29.96] What are the kids doing?
[   29.98 -    30.68] Where are they?
[   31.00 -    35.24] They're over here on Tiktok, you know, they're scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.
[   35.44 -    36.04] Okay.
[   36.12 -    38.04] There's all these brands, yada, yada.
[   38.32 -    38.68] Okay.
[   38.68 -    42.76] But if you're 20, 21, like you don't relate to Wall Street investors at all.
[   42.92 -    45.36] Wall Street investors do not relate to you.
[   45.36 -    48.60] You can't, they don't know what's going on in that world, but that
[   48.60 -    53.40] world is the next generation that's going ahead and going to be blowing
[   53.40 -    54.36] up these new companies.
[   54.36 -    54.64] Okay.
[   54.64 -    57.60] A good example of this is Abercrombie coming back.
[   57.64 -    58.92] Nobody saw that coming.
[   59.36 -    61.00] But then the chart went crazy.
[   61.00 -    61.28] Okay.
[   61.28 -    63.88] Let's see actually what the chart is looking like.
[   64.28 -    68.88] I'm just curious because this is just one example of many, but you can go
[   68.88 -    70.08] Google the guy.
[   70.08 -    71.48] His name is Chris Camillo.
[   71.92 -    74.48] You can go check out their YouTube channel, Dumb Money.
[   74.76 -    77.76] I've been watching this for a while and they have been following
[   77.76 -    81.88] this same mythology that I actually built a open claw for.
[   82.08 -    85.72] So I built an open claw for it and it essentially looks at
[   85.72 -    92.28] TikTok for you and comes up with a ton of companies that could be
[   92.28 -    93.44] bubbling right now.
[   95.04 -    95.80] Could be.
[   96.24 -    98.04] No, it's not going to just print you money.
[   98.04 -    98.88] Of course not.
[   99.12 -   100.80] Investing is way harder than that.
[  101.12 -   105.00] But this guy right here ran up a net worth of $80 million.
[  105.00 -   105.64] I was wrong.
[  107.36 -   108.52] You can do your research.
[  109.28 -   110.16] Don't believe me.
[  112.00 -   112.32] Shit.
[  112.36 -   113.32] Don't even believe him.
[  113.32 -   114.00] I don't care.
[  114.80 -   123.00] If you read Market Wizards, which I hope you do, Jack Schwager, he does
[  123.00 -   125.68] his own independent audits of people.
[  126.56 -   131.08] Market Wizards, Chris Camillo, you should probably read this book
[  132.00 -   136.78] because at the end of the day, ideas are everything.
[  138.54 -   143.14] So I built an open claw to execute his idea because I'm an algorithmic
[  143.14 -   144.70] trader process.
[  144.70 -   148.34] I follow starts with our research, research, research.
[  148.34 -   149.54] How do you research books?
[  149.90 -   152.26] The first book on this list, if you've actually been locked, if
[  152.26 -   154.22] you actually been following me, you should have read this book
[  154.22 -   154.50] already.
[  154.50 -   155.90] You should already know about Chris.
[  157.58 -   158.54] But if you didn't, that's okay.
[  158.54 -   163.82] Now, you know, and I got a open claw that works for me 24 seven,
[  164.38 -   171.22] 365, that is essentially searching for those trends.
[  172.50 -   175.70] So I want to give you a full tutorial here.
[  175.74 -   179.38] You can see she is cooking social arbitrage.
[  179.58 -   185.42] Let's go ahead and say, can you go ahead and give me a three sentence
[  185.42 -   190.82] overview of this TikTok process that we are doing?
[  191.82 -   194.82] Searching for trends, et cetera.
[  194.82 -   195.82] Thank you.
[  195.82 -   199.82] Just to get you fully up to speed here, then I'm going to give you all the code.
[  199.82 -   202.82] There's actually something funny about the code.
[  202.82 -   206.82] Okay, let's also, this is open claw on a different computer, by the way.
[  206.82 -   208.82] TikTok social arbitrage overview.
[  208.82 -   212.82] You're running an automated TikTok trend scanner every five minutes.
[  212.82 -   214.82] So we're scanning for trends.
[  214.82 -   216.82] We're scrolling through TikTok, scrolling through TikTok.
[  216.82 -   217.82] Remember, we're investors.
[  217.82 -   219.82] We're not in that generation.
[  219.82 -   221.82] Maybe you are, but I'm not.
[  221.82 -   222.82] I'm 36 years old.
[  222.82 -   224.82] I didn't learn to code until I was 30.
[  224.82 -   227.82] I think Chris Camillo is like 40, 50.
[  227.82 -   228.82] I don't know.
[  229.82 -   231.82] But he ran it up off this strategy.
[  231.82 -   235.82] So I'm just building AIs based off of ideas that I come up with.
[  235.82 -   240.82] Remember, the process of automating your trading starts with our research.
[  240.82 -   242.82] You have to come up with great ideas.
[  242.82 -   244.82] Nobody's going to feed you anything, dude.
[  244.82 -   245.82] This is war.
[  245.82 -   252.70] Then you back test those ideas, see if they work in the past.
[  252.70 -   255.70] Now, obviously this type of idea where you're scrolling through TikTok,
[  255.70 -   259.70] coming up with brands and then picking the very few that you think are actually good.
[  259.70 -   264.67] It's hard to back test, right?
[  264.67 -   269.24] But we all have all the excuses in the world.
[  269.24 -   270.24] How did I back test this?
[  270.24 -   274.24] I watched this dude do this for five more years after he talked about doing it for 10 years.
[  274.24 -   276.24] And then I put it into an AI.
[  276.24 -   277.24] Let's get it.
[  277.24 -   279.24] I'm going to give you all the code.
[  279.24 -   283.24] You can see it just sits here and it has a dashboard just cooking.
[  283.24 -   286.24] Just adding all the new ideas here all day.
[  287.24 -   288.24] I'm going to give you all the code.
[  288.24 -   289.24] Don't worry.
[  289.24 -   290.24] Open Claw.
[  290.24 -   295.24] You're running an automated TikTok trend scanner that hunts for emerging viral content
[  295.24 -   300.24] and brand opportunities by tracking new view velocity and engagement patterns.
[  300.24 -   303.24] It identifies videos and trends gaining momentum quickly.
[  303.24 -   307.24] Captures five plus data points to establish a reliable signal
[  307.24 -   312.24] and surfaces high potential opportunities that could be monetized or leveraged.
[  312.24 -   313.24] Could be, dude.
[  313.24 -   314.24] It's not spoon fed.
[  314.24 -   317.24] Could be or leverage across your other platforms.
[  317.24 -   319.24] The goal is to catch trends before they saturate.
[  321.24 -   332.40] Okay, so go ahead and make sure that the GitHub has all of the code here.
[  332.40 -   337.06] Make sure it's all uploaded.
[  337.06 -   340.06] You should have connection to your own GitHub already.
[  340.06 -   347.34] And make sure to read me a step by step so I could teach my friend how to build
[  347.34 -   351.34] this exact Open Claw flow.
[  351.34 -   353.34] Thank you.
[  353.34 -   357.34] You can see in the background, she's on TikTok, dude.
[  357.34 -   359.34] She's TikTok-ing right now.
[  359.34 -   364.14] She's TikTok-ing.
[  364.14 -   367.14] I have an AI TikTok-ing right now while you're scrolling right now.
[  367.14 -   372.31] Step on the gas, B.
[  372.31 -   373.31] This is war.
[  373.31 -   380.74] Let me check the scripts directory to see what automations exist.
[  380.74 -   389.62] Now I'll create a comprehensive step by step.
[  389.62 -   390.62] Read me.
[  390.62 -   393.62] This is Open Claw on a different computer cooking.
[  393.62 -   449.78] She's cooking.
[  449.78 -   464.20] Here's the API key and all that good stuff, bruh.
[  464.20 -   466.20] Thank you, Kenny.
[  466.20 -   467.20] Okay, let's get it.
[  467.20 -   468.20] Okay, look at these.
[  468.20 -   471.20] Let me go ahead and explain it to you, dude.
[  471.20 -   472.20] Uh-oh.
[  472.20 -   474.20] She went ahead and she got ghost on me.
[  474.20 -   475.20] I'll run the scanner.
[  475.20 -   476.20] She's running the scanner now.
[  476.20 -   478.20] Let's see if she put it on her GitHub.
[  478.20 -   479.20] Let's see.
[  479.20 -   481.20] GitHub.com.
[  481.20 -   483.20] Okay, reposts.
[  483.20 -   486.20] Dev social arbitrage here.
[  486.20 -   487.20] She did it two days ago.
[  487.20 -   488.20] She didn't upload it.
[  488.20 -   489.20] Yeah, now, now, now, now.
[  489.20 -   490.20] Okay, let's go over it.
[  490.20 -   491.20] Okay, this is the full tutorial, dude.
[  491.20 -   494.20] So if you want to know how to build this, there's something funny about this.
[  494.20 -   495.20] Let's go here.
[  495.20 -   497.20] Let's go to scripts.
[  497.20 -   498.20] MD, MD, MD.
[  498.20 -   500.20] If you're a coder, have you seen CodeJet?
[  500.20 -   503.54] I haven't seen CodeJet.
[  503.54 -   504.54] Experiments.
[  504.54 -   505.54] I'm running some experiments.
[  505.54 -   506.54] I'm testing different things.
[  506.54 -   507.54] I'll go over that after.
[  507.54 -   509.54] Okay, we're going to go deep here.
[  509.54 -   510.54] We're going to go fast as well.
[  510.54 -   511.54] So I'm not slowing down.
[  511.54 -   512.54] I'm sorry.
[  512.54 -   513.54] You can't keep up.
[  513.54 -   514.54] If you can't keep up, you can't keep up.
[  514.54 -   515.54] This is war.
[  515.54 -   516.54] Literally trading.
[  516.54 -   519.54] You are trying to take money from me.
[  519.54 -   520.54] I'm trying to take money from you.
[  520.54 -   521.54] We are traders, dude.
[  521.54 -   523.54] Nothing's plug and play.
[  523.54 -   527.54] Moondef, social arbitrage bot, TikTok trend scanning, plus Twitter alpha scanner.
[  527.54 -   528.54] By the way, did you see any code?
[  528.54 -   529.54] There's no code.
[  529.54 -   530.54] You got a little JS.
[  530.54 -   531.54] Okay.
[  531.54 -   532.54] Got a little JS.
[  532.54 -   533.54] You got a little JS.
[  533.54 -   534.54] Here's the code for the JS.
[  534.54 -   535.54] This is the Twitter alpha scanner here.
[  535.54 -   539.54] You can see Twitter alpha scanner scans following timeline for engagement.
[  539.54 -   540.54] Just screenshot it.
[  540.54 -   541.54] You can throw it to your AI.
[  541.54 -   542.54] Do whatever you need to do.
[  542.54 -   544.54] Initialize DB if needed.
[  544.54 -   545.54] So here you go.
[  545.54 -   548.54] We can see some, we are using a database here.
[  548.54 -   551.54] We're parsing engagement from the, this is actually Twitter alpha.
[  551.54 -   554.54] So actually I'm not even going to show you that after that.
[  554.54 -   556.54] That doesn't matter because this is Twitter alpha.
[  556.54 -   561.54] I'm looking, I'm also having her search Twitter, but let's keep it focused here.
[  561.54 -   564.54] TikTok trend scanning and Twitter alpha scanner.
[  564.54 -   566.54] Come on, bro.
[  566.54 -   567.54] You added both of these together.
[  567.54 -   568.54] That's fine.
[  568.54 -   570.54] Open claw autonomous flow that scans.
[  570.54 -   574.54] TikTok and Twitter, Twitter 24 seven finding trends and stocks.
[  574.54 -   576.54] I'm giving you more than what you even wanted to do.
[  576.54 -   577.54] You wanted the TikTok.
[  577.54 -   579.54] I'm giving you both what it does scans.
[  579.54 -   580.54] TikToks at four.
[  580.54 -   583.54] You pays every five minutes for rotating keywords, monitors,
[  583.54 -   586.54] Twitter and X following a feed for high engagement posts.
[  586.54 -   590.54] A hundred plus likes extracts brands, tickers, companies and engagement
[  590.54 -   594.54] metrics stores, findings and then JSON and CSV reports signals via
[  594.54 -   595.54] cron jobs.
[  595.54 -   596.54] That's the key.
[  596.54 -   597.54] They're just cron jobs.
[  597.54 -   602.42] You can think that we could create it.
[  602.42 -   609.42] See, that's the gift we were given to evolve, advance, create.
[  609.42 -   612.42] I create my own world.
[  612.42 -   613.42] Data dogs.
[  613.42 -   614.42] I'm the real data dog.
[  614.42 -   615.42] Let's get it.
[  615.42 -   617.42] Data dog synthetics with the alley.
[  617.42 -   618.42] What's included.
[  618.42 -   619.42] Okay.
[  619.42 -   620.42] So this is the structure again.
[  620.42 -   622.42] You can screenshot whatever you need to screenshot.
[  622.42 -   624.42] You can see I added in the Twitter engagement to this.
[  624.42 -   628.42] So now you have TikTok and Twitter, a little bonus because you stuck around
[  628.42 -   629.42] for 10 minutes.
[  629.42 -   631.42] You don't have a brain where I like the rest of the kids out there
[  631.42 -   633.42] that want plug and play, get rich overnight.
[  633.42 -   634.42] You ain't going to get rich overnight, dude.
[  634.42 -   635.42] I'm competing with you.
[  635.42 -   636.42] Let's get it.
[  636.42 -   638.42] I'm just nicer than the rest.
[  638.42 -   640.42] I believe code is a great equalizer.
[  640.42 -   642.42] If I show everything, you might build something.
[  642.42 -   643.42] You might learn how to code.
[  643.42 -   645.42] You might change your life.
[  645.42 -   646.42] Step by step build.
[  646.42 -   647.42] Pre-rex.
[  647.42 -   649.42] You need Open Claw installed.
[  649.42 -   650.42] Okay.
[  650.42 -   651.42] You need Node.js.
[  651.42 -   652.42] Okay.
[  652.42 -   654.42] You need the automation, browser automation capability.
[  654.42 -   655.42] That should be easy.
[  655.42 -   656.42] A local workspace.
[  656.42 -   657.42] Okay.
[  657.42 -   658.42] That's perfect.
[  658.42 -   659.42] You want to check your setup?
[  659.42 -   660.42] Yada yada.
[  660.42 -   661.42] Clone the repo?
[  661.42 -   662.42] No.
[  662.42 -   663.42] There's no cloning.
[  663.42 -   664.42] I'm not going to put this repo out.
[  664.42 -   665.42] Why am I going to do that?
[  665.42 -   666.42] Why am I going to do that?
[  666.42 -   667.42] This is war.
[  667.42 -   668.42] If you can't keep up, you can't keep up.
[  668.42 -   669.42] I'm giving you everything here.
[  669.42 -   670.42] Lock in.
[  670.42 -   671.42] 10 minutes, dude.
[  671.42 -   672.42] Stop scrolling.
[  672.42 -   673.42] Let the AI scroll for you.
[  673.42 -   676.42] If you can't sit through 10 more minutes here, you can't have this.
[  676.42 -   677.42] I'm sorry.
[  677.42 -   679.42] Or manually create the folder.
[  679.42 -   680.42] I don't do open source.
[  680.42 -   681.42] I'm sorry, dude.
[  681.42 -   684.42] I'll show you everything, but that's only for killers
[  684.42 -   686.42] because if you're actually going to lock in for these videos,
[  686.42 -   687.42] I want to be around you.
[  687.42 -   690.42] If you need to copy, paste my code, get goes.
[  690.42 -   692.42] Verify file structure.
[  692.42 -   694.42] Make sure all of these files are here.
[  694.42 -   695.42] Okay.
[  695.42 -   696.42] You're going to be able to have those.
[  696.42 -   697.42] I'll send them to you.
[  697.42 -   698.42] I'll show you.
[  698.42 -   699.42] Show them to you.
[  699.42 -   700.42] I'm not going to send them to you.
[  700.42 -   701.42] Set up the dashboard server.
[  701.42 -   702.42] The dashboard server.
[  702.42 -   704.42] I put it on three, four, five, six.
[  704.42 -   705.42] It doesn't matter.
[  705.42 -   707.42] You can see there's a nice dashboard to it.
[  707.42 -   709.42] So I'll show you the dashboard.
[  709.42 -   713.42] I already did, but let's go see if we can show it again.
[  713.42 -   715.42] Dashboards looking a little like this.
[  715.42 -   719.42] My question is, is where is the code for the dashboard?
[  719.42 -   728.93] Is the code for the social arbitrage dashboard in the GitHub?
[  728.93 -   731.93] The one that is here.
[  731.93 -   732.93] This one's fire, dude.
[  732.93 -   733.93] This is fire.
[  733.93 -   735.93] Three, four, five, six.
[  735.93 -   738.78] Okay.
[  738.78 -   740.78] If not, make sure it is.
[  740.78 -   741.78] Okay.
[  741.78 -   744.78] So let's keep going through the Github's here.
[  744.78 -   747.78] Option B background services.
[  747.78 -   748.78] Okay.
[  748.78 -   750.78] Set up the cron jobs.
[  750.78 -   753.78] So I'm assuming you're going to use open claw for this.
[  753.78 -   758.78] So you literally just need these, like the push, like how I built it, right?
[  758.78 -   760.78] You don't need me to walk through all the code.
[  760.78 -   761.78] Set up via open claw.
[  761.78 -   763.78] You can see a little cron job here.
[  763.78 -   764.78] Scan tick tock for you page.
[  764.78 -   765.78] Use the anthropic.
[  765.78 -   767.78] I push it to 4.5 haiku.
[  767.78 -   771.78] I think I'm using haiku 4.5 as we speak.
[  771.78 -   776.78] As we speak for the open claw stuff because I actually got a job to do.
[  777.78 -   779.78] I need my opus, bro.
[  779.78 -   781.78] I need my opus.
[  781.78 -   783.78] So that was kind of my thesis though.
[  783.78 -   785.78] Haiku is going to be fine for a lot of this stuff.
[  785.78 -   787.78] You can try what you want prior.
[  787.78 -   791.78] I was using opus 4.5, but I am hitting the weekly limits and it's Monday.
[  791.78 -   793.78] I don't know when those reset.
[  793.78 -   795.78] Try what you'd like there.
[  795.78 -   803.78] My thesis though, or I might try to prove that out today, but essentially right now it's very hard to.
[  804.78 -   807.78] It's very hard to use open claw without clawed.
[  807.78 -   814.78] Now you can test it out yourself, but here you can see this is some code, but it's just ran here.
[  814.78 -   816.78] Job B Twitter alpha scanner.
[  816.78 -   817.78] If you want this as well.
[  817.78 -   822.78] So I'm also scanning through Twitter to find alpha as well.
[  822.78 -   825.78] Identify posts with 100 plus likes.
[  825.78 -   827.78] Some sort of signal might be there.
[  827.78 -   828.78] I'll see new trends.
[  828.78 -   831.78] You see what I'm saying as I am an algorithmic trader.
[  831.78 -   836.78] All comes down to R for me because my infrastructure is thick at this point.
[  836.78 -   838.78] I've got the B in the eye down.
[  838.78 -   842.78] I can do these things so easily that it's all about R.
[  842.78 -   844.78] It's all about ideas for me.
[  844.78 -   852.78] So that's why I share everything in reality because if I share everything, I'm going to get everybody's opinion on it.
[  852.78 -   854.78] And that's going to trigger new ideas for me.
[  854.78 -   860.78] So since the system that I follow every day, the process of automating your trading, it starts with research.
[  860.78 -   861.78] It starts with ideas.
[  861.78 -   862.78] I've given you all my books.
[  862.78 -   867.19] I've given you all my sources for papers.
[  867.19 -   873.19] If I share everything with you, you're going to give me ideas back just by saying a word positive or negative.
[  873.19 -   874.19] It doesn't matter.
[  874.19 -   876.19] I can pull ideas and learn from anyone.
[  876.19 -   879.19] The R is the secret to algorithmic trading.
[  879.19 -   885.19] Once you are in the game, because once you're in the game back testing and implementing, I've got templates for this.
[  885.19 -   888.19] I should give you a template here, which is crazy.
[  889.19 -   893.19] If you do want this roadmap, let's keep going through this.
[  893.19 -   896.19] You can see Connect Browser for Automation for the bots.
[  896.19 -   898.19] You're going to have to sign in to TikTok.
[  898.19 -   901.19] Some of you are going to be too scared to do that, and that is fine.
[  901.19 -   903.19] You're going to have to sign in to Twitter.
[  903.19 -   913.05] Just got to ask Open Claw to say, hey, open up a page to let me sign in to my TikTok and Twitter.
[  913.05 -   916.05] If you got to go home, it's okay.
[  916.05 -   918.05] Verification, Open Claw status here.
[  918.05 -   919.05] Run a test.
[  919.05 -   920.05] Okay.
[  920.05 -   922.05] This is just some slot for the AI.
[  922.05 -   923.05] This is what you really need.
[  923.05 -   924.05] Start the dashboard.
[  924.05 -   930.05] It does have the dashboard, it says, but what I'm confused about is where's the code to that dashboard?
[  930.05 -   932.05] Because I want to get you that.
[  932.05 -   933.05] I want to get you that.
[  933.05 -   935.05] Monitor and optimize.
[  935.05 -   939.05] These are just literally instructions for Open Claw.
[  939.05 -   941.05] Top signals found.
[  941.05 -   945.05] These are just some top signals they found so far.
[  945.05 -   952.15] Then here's some troubleshooting that your AI might use.
[  952.15 -   957.15] Agents.md, daily cron job, configurations, instructions, brands.
[  957.15 -   960.46] Let's see if she said anything back.
[  960.46 -   968.46] This is a poor part of Open Claw in my opinion.
[  968.46 -   972.67] How it doesn't have a good chat.
[  972.67 -   978.98] Hey, so can you just let me know about that code?
[  978.98 -   988.98] Is there actually code in the TikTok, Twitter, Scanner, Alpha, GitHub, or is it just cron jobs?
[  988.98 -   992.98] Yeah, if you can upload the code for the dashboard specifically, that's what I'm looking for.
[  992.98 -   994.98] I'm trying to show a friend.
[  994.98 -   999.42] I'm trying to show a friend.
[  999.42 -  1001.42] A friend of me.
[ 1001.42 -  1003.42] I'm trying to show a friend of me, dude.
[ 1003.42 -  1006.40] That's it.
[ 1006.40 -  1008.40] I'm trying to show a friend of me.
[ 1008.40 -  1009.40] Let, let what?
[ 1009.40 -  1010.40] Let's get it.
[ 1010.40 -  1011.40] Let's get it.
[ 1011.40 -  1012.40] Let's get it.
[ 1012.40 -  1013.40] Oh, lock in.
[ 1013.40 -  1014.40] It's time.
[ 1014.40 -  1015.40] All right.
[ 1015.40 -  1020.40] So, yep, there's a, there's full working code here, but not, not just cron jobs.
[ 1020.40 -  1021.40] Let me upload.
[ 1021.40 -  1022.40] Okay.
[ 1022.40 -  1023.40] There we go.
[ 1023.40 -  1025.40] I was going to say there's definitely some code to this.
[ 1025.40 -  1027.40] I'm giving you the dashboard and all that good stuff.
[ 1027.40 -  1033.40] So spending a little time here because you guys want it and I'm not going to just
[ 1033.40 -  1035.40] drop the code in GitHub again.
[ 1035.40 -  1036.40] I've tried open source.
[ 1036.40 -  1038.40] Nobody steps on the gas like me.
[ 1038.40 -  1040.40] So nobody really, I don't know.
[ 1040.40 -  1042.40] It doesn't live up to my expectations.
[ 1042.40 -  1045.40] I thought open source stepped on the gas way harder than they do.
[ 1045.40 -  1046.40] They don't.
[ 1046.40 -  1047.40] Let's get it.
[ 1047.40 -  1049.40] Let's do closed source and see who gets to Jim summons first.
[ 1049.40 -  1050.40] How about that?
[ 1050.40 -  1053.40] I'll show you everything along the way because I do believe codes are great.
[ 1053.40 -  1057.40] And I do believe if you give, you get 10,000 X back.
[ 1057.40 -  1058.40] Yes.
[ 1058.40 -  1059.40] There's a real code here.
[ 1059.40 -  1060.40] So server.js.
[ 1060.40 -  1061.40] Okay.
[ 1061.40 -  1062.40] You're going to need that.
[ 1062.40 -  1063.40] You're going to need dashboard index.
[ 1063.40 -  1064.40] Okay.
[ 1064.40 -  1066.40] To show your friend, start the server.
[ 1066.40 -  1068.40] Open the browser.
[ 1068.40 -  1071.40] See real dashboard files.
[ 1071.40 -  1073.40] Just make sure.
[ 1073.40 -  1079.40] Just make sure all the code is uploaded on the GitHub.
[ 1079.40 -  1080.40] Now.
[ 1080.40 -  1081.40] Okay.
[ 1081.40 -  1083.40] So we got this will go over.
[ 1083.40 -  1087.40] We've got actually a few things to go over, but I want to give you the full capacity
[ 1087.40 -  1089.40] of what I know so you can build your own ideas.
[ 1089.40 -  1092.40] Obviously your system is going to be better than mine.
[ 1092.40 -  1093.40] I started this.
[ 1093.40 -  1096.40] I built it version zero.
[ 1096.40 -  1098.40] I've updated it one time.
[ 1098.40 -  1100.40] I can't wait to see what you do with it.
[ 1100.40 -  1102.40] You see how I do this dude.
[ 1102.40 -  1104.40] I test all types of ideas.
[ 1104.40 -  1108.40] I'm chasing a man that ran up a net worth of $31 billion.
[ 1108.40 -  1110.40] I have to test everything.
[ 1110.40 -  1113.40] And then I pick which one do I want to follow deeper.
[ 1113.40 -  1117.40] And that's how I've always ran my life and my business, everything.
[ 1117.40 -  1119.40] I don't know anything.
[ 1119.40 -  1122.40] I start from a position of not knowing anything.
[ 1122.40 -  1124.40] I try to read everything.
[ 1124.40 -  1127.40] I learn everything that I test everything I can think of.
[ 1127.40 -  1129.40] And then I can't think of anything.
[ 1129.40 -  1131.40] So I find a way to think of more.
[ 1131.40 -  1137.40] Thank you for engaging and throwing your ideas and your questions.
[ 1137.40 -  1139.40] Because I learned from your questions.
[ 1139.40 -  1140.40] I learned from your comments.
[ 1140.40 -  1141.40] It's so, so beautiful.
[ 1141.40 -  1142.40] Much love to you.
[ 1142.40 -  1143.40] Seven seven seven.
[ 1143.40 -  1144.40] So all the code is here.
[ 1144.40 -  1148.40] So it's on moon dev cracker moon dev social R.
[ 1148.40 -  1150.40] You got the server JS to okay.
[ 1150.40 -  1151.40] Perfect.
[ 1151.40 -  1154.40] Twitter alpha JS dashboard.
[ 1154.40 -  1156.40] Read me agents.md.
[ 1156.40 -  1158.40] Okay, so we're going to keep going through here then.
[ 1158.40 -  1161.40] You saw everything on the read me here.
[ 1161.40 -  1165.40] And now I want to give you the other files that we do.
[ 1165.40 -  1168.40] See are useful.
[ 1168.40 -  1170.40] So data experiment scripts.
[ 1170.40 -  1172.40] Let's get agents open.
[ 1172.40 -  1174.40] Let's get dashboard open.
[ 1174.40 -  1180.40] Server.js open and then Twitter alpha open and then anything
[ 1180.40 -  1182.40] experiments probably not.
[ 1182.40 -  1183.40] And cron jobs.
[ 1183.40 -  1186.40] We'll go ahead and go through these cron jobs real quick.
[ 1186.40 -  1190.40] So this is a social Tik Tok social cron job every five minutes
[ 1190.40 -  1193.40] open Tik Tok scroll through five to 10 videos.
[ 1193.40 -  1195.40] Brand detection criteria.
[ 1195.40 -  1199.40] So I have different captions and hashtags that were
[ 1199.40 -  1201.40] dropped by dumb money.
[ 1201.40 -  1202.40] Appreciate them.
[ 1202.40 -  1204.40] And then I expanded on them a little bit.
[ 1204.40 -  1206.40] You can see investable check.
[ 1206.40 -  1209.40] Is it publicly traded note ticker?
[ 1209.40 -  1210.40] Okay.
[ 1210.40 -  1211.40] Private but owned.
[ 1211.40 -  1212.40] Okay.
[ 1212.40 -  1213.40] It's not.
[ 1213.40 -  1215.40] No, it's, it's what's called machine learning.
[ 1215.40 -  1220.40] So you find things that are predictive.
[ 1220.40 -  1225.40] You might guess, oh, such and such should be predictive,
[ 1225.40 -  1226.40] might be predictive.
[ 1226.40 -  1228.40] And you test it out on the computer and maybe it isn't.
[ 1228.40 -  1229.40] Maybe it isn't.
[ 1229.40 -  1235.40] You test it out on long term historical data and price
[ 1235.40 -  1236.40] data and other things.
[ 1236.40 -  1239.40] And then you add to the system this if it works.
[ 1239.40 -  1242.40] And if it doesn't, you throw it out.
[ 1242.40 -  1246.40] So there aren't elaborate equations, at least not for.
[ 1246.40 -  1249.40] That was the $31 billion man by the way.
[ 1249.40 -  1251.40] He said there's nothing elaborate around here.
[ 1251.40 -  1253.40] You just have to step on the gas and come up with ideas
[ 1253.40 -  1255.40] and test to see if they worked in the past.
[ 1255.40 -  1257.40] If they work in the past, they're much more likely
[ 1257.40 -  1258.40] to work in the future.
[ 1258.40 -  1260.40] Literally the RBI system.
[ 1260.40 -  1262.40] I just simplified it.
[ 1262.40 -  1264.40] So it comes down to ideas.
[ 1264.40 -  1268.40] So this dashboard is going to give you ideas.
[ 1268.40 -  1273.40] Ideas, maybe one out of 100 are actually a good idea.
[ 1273.40 -  1275.40] You still got to be a grown up dude.
[ 1275.40 -  1276.40] This is war.
[ 1276.40 -  1279.40] You still got to make the connections.
[ 1279.40 -  1280.40] But look at this.
[ 1280.40 -  1281.40] This is pretty cool.
[ 1281.40 -  1285.40] It sees if it's a publicly traded company.
[ 1285.40 -  1286.40] It notes the ticker.
[ 1286.40 -  1289.40] If it's private but owned by a public company,
[ 1289.40 -  1291.40] it notes the parent.
[ 1291.40 -  1293.40] Anthropic kind of Amazon.
[ 1293.40 -  1295.40] Could go public soon.
[ 1295.40 -  1297.40] No as pre IPO.
[ 1297.40 -  1298.40] That's interesting.
[ 1298.40 -  1299.40] Having pre IPOs.
[ 1299.40 -  1301.40] Okay.
[ 1301.40 -  1304.40] And it's putting it all here on the dashboard.
[ 1304.40 -  1308.40] Once you're done with this video here.
[ 1308.40 -  1309.40] No investment path.
[ 1309.40 -  1311.40] It will skip, but you can change this.
[ 1311.40 -  1314.40] And then confidence scoring everybody's is going to be different.
[ 1314.40 -  1318.90] Part of the reason I don't just drop code.
[ 1318.90 -  1323.18] I want everybody's to be different.
[ 1323.18 -  1325.18] We need everybody's to be different.
[ 1325.18 -  1327.18] We need to research different angles.
[ 1327.18 -  1330.18] This is my version zero.
[ 1330.18 -  1333.18] Why would you want to just copy somebody's version?
[ 1333.18 -  1336.18] I want to teach you how to fish for the rest of your life.
[ 1336.18 -  1338.18] So let's get it.
[ 1338.18 -  1339.18] You can see confidence scoring.
[ 1339.18 -  1341.18] So we're scoring them based off of confidence.
[ 1341.18 -  1343.18] And then we're pushing the gear.
[ 1343.18 -  1344.18] Okay.
[ 1344.18 -  1345.18] So what else is in this scripts folder?
[ 1345.18 -  1347.18] We did monitors, instructions.
[ 1347.18 -  1348.18] Okay.
[ 1348.18 -  1349.18] Chron config.md.
[ 1349.18 -  1350.18] So tick tock social arbitrage,
[ 1350.18 -  1352.18] chron configuration, how it works.
[ 1352.18 -  1354.18] Essentially it's just opening the tick tock and then rotating
[ 1354.18 -  1355.18] through these chron jobs.
[ 1355.18 -  1358.18] This is alpha right here, keyword rotation.
[ 1358.18 -  1362.51] These keywords are the things that,
[ 1362.51 -  1364.51] that change your for you pays.
[ 1364.51 -  1367.51] These are the things that if you start searching these every day,
[ 1367.51 -  1370.51] these are the things that are like sold out everywhere.
[ 1370.51 -  1372.51] That could lead to a signal.
[ 1372.51 -  1373.51] They keep selling out.
[ 1373.51 -  1374.51] That could lead to a signal.
[ 1374.51 -  1375.51] Restock alert.
[ 1375.51 -  1377.51] That could lead to a signal.
[ 1377.51 -  1378.51] You have two options.
[ 1378.51 -  1382.51] You can go and search this on your phone right now all day long
[ 1382.51 -  1385.51] or build up, build a open cloud like this.
[ 1385.51 -  1387.51] It just does that and searches these,
[ 1387.51 -  1390.51] these searches and sees the demand for,
[ 1390.51 -  1393.51] you know, DTC brands or retail demand,
[ 1393.51 -  1395.51] I've, et cetera, et cetera.
[ 1395.51 -  1397.51] It's data schema here.
[ 1397.51 -  1399.51] And there's so much to update.
[ 1399.51 -  1401.51] I'm actually getting very excited going through this.
[ 1401.51 -  1403.51] So you can see everything to replicate this
[ 1403.51 -  1405.51] and take it to the next level.
[ 1405.51 -  1407.51] Dude, please, please, please take it to the next level.
[ 1407.51 -  1409.51] Take it to the next level.
[ 1409.51 -  1411.51] I'm giving you everything sample chron job prompt.
[ 1411.51 -  1414.51] This is what the open cloud chron job sends.
[ 1414.51 -  1421.50] What happens each cycle?
[ 1421.50 -  1423.50] Essentially, yeah, I'm not going to read all that,
[ 1423.50 -  1426.50] but you can read it and example output here.
[ 1426.50 -  1428.91] Okay.
[ 1428.91 -  1430.91] So you've seen all the scripts here in the scripts folder.
[ 1430.91 -  1433.91] Let's just dive into these last three things
[ 1433.91 -  1435.91] and see if there's anything else that you have
[ 1435.91 -  1436.91] clarification needed on.
[ 1436.91 -  1437.91] Let me know in the chat.
[ 1437.91 -  1440.91] So agents.md, Tiktok social arbitrage agent,
[ 1440.91 -  1442.91] what it does scans Tiktok every five minutes.
[ 1442.91 -  1444.91] Here's a little bit of code for the chron job.
[ 1444.91 -  1449.38] You can see it's grabbing the agents instructions.
[ 1449.38 -  1450.38] I'll give you that.
[ 1450.38 -  1451.38] That's this.
[ 1451.38 -  1452.38] That's this.
[ 1452.38 -  1454.38] For each cycle, it goes ahead and reads this.
[ 1454.38 -  1458.38] You can see there's actually no .py files or .j songs
[ 1458.38 -  1459.38] or .js, which is far.
[ 1459.38 -  1462.38] There's one, but get current keyword here.
[ 1462.38 -  1463.38] Gets the keyword.
[ 1463.38 -  1465.38] Again, the keyword that I showed you just a second ago,
[ 1465.38 -  1466.38] that's pure alpha.
[ 1466.38 -  1468.38] If you didn't screenshot that, you're cooked.
[ 1468.38 -  1471.38] Search Tiktok, use browser tool.
[ 1471.38 -  1472.38] Okay.
[ 1472.38 -  1474.38] So we're using a browser tool to just search Tiktok.
[ 1474.38 -  1476.38] You can see this is not heavy AI.
[ 1476.38 -  1478.38] It's not heavy AI, dude.
[ 1478.38 -  1482.38] It's not extract all visual videos, but the only reason this
[ 1482.38 -  1486.38] is doable is because of open cloud able to be AI to control
[ 1486.38 -  1487.38] your computer.
[ 1487.38 -  1488.38] Right.
[ 1488.38 -  1489.38] So I think it's pretty fire.
[ 1489.38 -  1491.38] I think this is a pretty fire tool.
[ 1491.38 -  1492.38] I'm just dropping for free here.
[ 1492.38 -  1493.38] So much love to you.
[ 1493.38 -  1496.38] Just throw a 777 in the chat when you see me, dude.
[ 1496.38 -  1498.38] You can see the keywords here rotating.
[ 1498.38 -  1500.38] So you can take this to a whole nother level.
[ 1500.38 -  1501.38] I have a list of 30 more keywords.
[ 1501.38 -  1502.38] Come on.
[ 1502.38 -  1503.38] Let's get it.
[ 1503.38 -  1505.38] These might not even be good keywords.
[ 1505.38 -  1506.38] Let's get it.
[ 1506.38 -  1507.38] You can do this, dude.
[ 1507.38 -  1510.38] You can do anything that they can do, but you can do it better.
[ 1510.38 -  1512.38] Anything that I can do, you can do it way better.
[ 1512.38 -  1516.38] Take your guessing symbols or guessing rules when you see a brand
[ 1516.38 -  1517.38] match to the public company.
[ 1517.38 -  1521.38] So given an example here, high confidence, medium confidence
[ 1521.38 -  1524.38] based off of, okay, they see Adidas.
[ 1524.38 -  1525.38] It might be that.
[ 1525.38 -  1526.38] They see Nike or Jordan.
[ 1526.38 -  1529.38] It might be Nike, Starbucks might be Starbucks, S-Bucks.
[ 1529.38 -  1532.70] File structure here.
[ 1532.70 -  1533.70] You can see that.
[ 1533.70 -  1535.70] And then here's the experiment system.
[ 1535.70 -  1538.70] Always log active experiments, CSV.
[ 1538.70 -  1541.70] So I go ahead and just run different experiments.
[ 1541.70 -  1542.70] I've only run two, to be honest.
[ 1542.70 -  1544.70] I showed you the first one and then I did a second one.
[ 1544.70 -  1549.70] And I just like to test the experiments to see what gets the best alpha.
[ 1549.70 -  1552.70] Again, this is version zero, version one, whatever you want to call it.
[ 1552.70 -  1554.70] CSV schema here.
[ 1554.70 -  1558.70] So I'm tracking all of this stuff here in order to get the ticker guests
[ 1558.70 -  1560.70] because the ticker guests will power this.
[ 1560.70 -  1564.70] All of this CSV tracking is powering that.
[ 1564.70 -  1567.70] And then example scan output is what we're going to see.
[ 1567.70 -  1572.70] It scans and outputs it every few minutes here onto the open claw.
[ 1572.70 -  1580.08] So she's probably outputted something here.
[ 1580.08 -  1582.08] She's having some problem with the Twitter part,
[ 1582.08 -  1585.08] but I think the real alpha here is the TikTok part.
[ 1585.08 -  1587.08] And that's what we came for.
[ 1587.08 -  1589.08] I can fix that here in a second.
[ 1589.08 -  1591.08] So tips always filtered by this week.
[ 1591.08 -  1592.08] So this is a key.
[ 1592.08 -  1595.08] I like new videos, but that could be wrong.
[ 1595.08 -  1598.08] You know, go deep 200 videos per scan.
[ 1598.08 -  1602.70] Why this week filter matters.
[ 1602.70 -  1604.70] Videos from months ago still appear in search.
[ 1604.70 -  1606.70] Oh, they went viral a long time ago.
[ 1606.70 -  1612.06] Okay.
[ 1612.06 -  1615.06] Let's see if there's any other files I want to show you here.
[ 1615.06 -  1618.06] Code overview for the social R of the stack here.
[ 1618.06 -  1620.06] You can see JSON.
[ 1620.06 -  1622.06] We use the server.js.
[ 1622.06 -  1627.78] We add all the data to this data folder here.
[ 1627.78 -  1635.80] The dashboard UI, the dashboard UI is under dashboard dot index stop HTML.
[ 1635.80 -  1637.80] I'll go ahead and try to find that.
[ 1637.80 -  1638.80] But I didn't see it actually.
[ 1638.80 -  1640.80] So vanilla JavaScript here.
[ 1640.80 -  1643.80] No frameworks server API server.js.
[ 1643.80 -  1645.80] I'll show you that in a second.
[ 1645.80 -  1646.80] How it works.
[ 1646.80 -  1648.80] It goes on port 3456.
[ 1648.80 -  1651.80] You can change that to whatever that you want.
[ 1651.80 -  1652.80] Then the Twitter scanner.
[ 1652.80 -  1655.80] I'm not going to go over that because this is just too much code here.
[ 1655.80 -  1656.80] And I've shown you enough.
[ 1656.80 -  1658.80] I think you get the point.
[ 1658.80 -  1660.80] Use Claude to build this dude.
[ 1660.80 -  1662.80] Use Claude open claw.
[ 1662.80 -  1664.80] Don't use any other AI dude.
[ 1664.80 -  1665.80] We're open.
[ 1665.80 -  1666.80] We're not open AI guys anymore.
[ 1666.80 -  1667.80] We're not.
[ 1667.80 -  1668.80] I used to be.
[ 1668.80 -  1670.80] I used to be, but not anymore.
[ 1670.80 -  1672.80] So Claude.
[ 1672.80 -  1673.80] Okay.
[ 1673.80 -  1676.80] So here's a server.js just so you can see it really quickly.
[ 1676.80 -  1680.80] A lot of code here that might be useful for speeding up your thing.
[ 1680.80 -  1682.80] But also it was written by AI.
[ 1682.80 -  1687.80] So I think the important part that I showed you today were the keywords and the setup
[ 1687.80 -  1688.80] of how this works.
[ 1688.80 -  1690.80] You can see it's very low code.
[ 1690.80 -  1694.80] So this is the Twitter alpha scanner.js as well.
[ 1694.80 -  1695.80] Very low code.
[ 1695.80 -  1698.80] And I want to find the dashboard for you.
[ 1698.80 -  1701.80] If I can, but if I can't, I'm sure you can build your own dashboard because
[ 1701.80 -  1705.80] at the end of the day, that dashboard is based off of all of the other stuff.
[ 1705.80 -  1709.80] I showed you how it saves the cron job to the CSV.
[ 1709.80 -  1713.80] And if this stuff just doesn't make sense to you, then you're cooked.
[ 1713.80 -  1714.80] I'm just kidding, bro.
[ 1714.80 -  1715.80] I'm kidding, dude.
[ 1715.80 -  1716.80] I'm kidding.
[ 1716.80 -  1717.80] You're not cooked.
[ 1717.80 -  1720.80] I didn't learn how to code to always 30 either.
[ 1720.80 -  1723.80] You're cooked if you're like 22 thinking you're too late.
[ 1723.80 -  1725.80] That's when you're cooked.
[ 1725.80 -  1728.80] And I know one of you is 22 thinking you're too late.
[ 1728.80 -  1732.80] So you could build anything, dude.
[ 1732.80 -  1736.80] Let's go ahead and see if I can find this dashboard board for you.
[ 1736.80 -  1739.80] But if I can't, then it's all good.
[ 1739.80 -  1740.80] You can find it, dude.
[ 1740.80 -  1741.80] You can build it.
[ 1741.80 -  1742.80] Much love to you.
[ 1742.80 -  1743.80] Have fun.
